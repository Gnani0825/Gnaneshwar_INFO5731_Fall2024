There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief' and that is the success of this movie. There is hardly any sugarcoating to the criminal angle of Rocky, and it is more of a man with a promise to fulfill. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a honest 'masala movie'!!\n",

The film starts right from where the first film ended, Rocky taking over KGF & all of his adversaries rushing in to claim their stakes. Instead of the relentless action in the first film, this time you get political & strategic plays, with both sides taking wins & losses. The dialogues are great once again, Performances from Yash, Sanjay Dutt & Raveena Tandon were superb. Great Cinematography & Music that evokes the emotions. The romantic angle is better in this one & the great emotional bond of Mother & Son is once again central to the plot. But there are big issues in screenplay & editing. Instead of the streamlined story of the first film, this one stretches in so many directions & it becomes really tough to keep up with it. A lot of scenes abruptly end & I expected the ending to be much more powerful. A great effort but ultimately falls short of expectations.\n",

Some fools may say that KGF Chapter 2 is terrible, but being a movie lover I really loved the content. This really did well above the expectations and I really loved it. This movie is only made for action movie lovers only, Family sentiment and love story movie lovers will surely dislike due to it's action scenes. That's because these guys ain't have brain and Intelligence Quotient in their brain to understand this movie. Better I recommend them to watch love story/ Family Sentiment movies rather than Action Movies like KGF Chapter 2.Ps: The spoiler is Achyuth Kumar, who played the role of Gurupandian is the main Antagonist, not Sanjay Dutt.\n",

            "review: Huge fan of Chapter 1, which had much more direct plot and gave Rocky a good character arc, while still making him appear like a very cunning, gray character. Chapter 2 has a fast-paced screenplay too, but it collapses under the weight of all the characters and story that has to be packed in. Rocky doesn't have very much room to grow as a character and is overall just a vessel to deliver elevation scenes. However, in Chapter 2 the elevation scenes don't land nearly as well as the movie lacks the emotional depth of the first. When the screenplay is shifting from place to place quickly and rushing through plot points, there is not much room to setup stakes and emotional payoff, which is this film rings hollower than Chapter 1. Chapter 1's first half is basically how all of Chapter 2 plays out, except the novelty of style and new characters from Chapter 1 is gone since Chapter 2 is the sequel.This movie has 3 very powerful villains on paper, but Adheera and Inayat Khalil are underwhelming on screen. Ramika Sen is a good adversary to Rocky, but comes a bit too late in the story. Even though Garuda never met or fought Rocky in Chapter 1, he was mounted as a much scarier villains than the antagonists in Chapter 2.Also, surprisingly KGF 2 is light on action, especially in the first half, as Rocky is not fighting as much anymore. That being said, the scale of the action, the cinematography and overall stakes are better in Chapter 2. The ending if somewhat predictable, but it is nice that the narrators of Chapter 2 add more mystery to the how real Rocky's mythos is, which makes Chapter 2 a little more interesting in that regard.Chapter 1 built a great platform for Chapter 2, but Chapter 2 does not concern itself with delivering on the massive hype for its 3 villains, further developing Rocky's character or raising the emotional stakes. Chapter 2 is instead more of a machine that connects cool set pieces, which are working wonders with mass audiences, but are underwhelming to audiences that connected more deeply with Chapter 1. KGF 2 is better than a fair share of movies, and its success worldwide is also commendable. I just wish it was better.\n",

            "review: KGF - Chapter 1, set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.\n",

More than the whole film, I'd love to ask him someday about the impact its climax left him with as he watched it in what I imagine to be an old theatre, wherever he grew up. Like the iconic theatre scene in Cinema Paradiso, this moment must have been Prashanth's big life-altering moment, his metamorphosis where he not only discovered the magic of movies but also the concept of \"mass\" before it became a thing. Without sounding too dramatic, something must have clicked in him because there's no one here who thinks in intercuts like this man.Read the full review on Film Companion.\n",

KGF 2 is blessed by a strong cast starting from Yash's Rocky which is the sole factor to watch the whole movie. His ravishing presence carries the whole movie upto an extent. Raveena Tandon is another factor to watch put for because her stern character was hell of a surprising delight. Coming to mass scenes, although most of them did not land well for me..Rocky's entry, return etc where top notch scenes which are not to be missed.Length is the biggest factor that drags the movie back. Moreover a bunch of mass scenes felt like over stuffed and felt the flick would have been better without those. Not a wow factor twist and cliche sequences adds to the cons.A satisfying ok end to a two part tale in the endRating:67/100.\n",
